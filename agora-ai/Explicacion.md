# Service Launch Workflow

Vamos a implementar un **agent-based workflow**.  
Each critical role required for the project will be assigned to a specialized agent or professional, ensuring focused and efficient task execution. Eventualmente los LLMs van a romper el codebase, algo va a dejar de funcionar, asi que documentar y granulizar es la unica forma de manterse consistente usando IA para desarrollos de proyectos grandes. 
  
The workflow follows **Agile methodology** principles, organized in the following sequence:

## Workflow Stages

1. **Business Analyst**  
   - Gathers requirements.
   - Refines product vision through continuous dialogue and iteration.

2. **Product Manager**  
   - Conducts market research.
   - Benchmarks competitors and identifies opportunities for improvement.

3. **Architect**  
   - Designs the technical architecture.
   - Defines the technology stack, frameworks, databases, and system integration.

4. **Product Owner**  
   - Breaks down the product vision and architecture into detailed, actionable features.
   - Ensures all requirements are clear, granular, and ready for development.

5. **Scrum Master**  
   - Translates the Product Owner's artifacts into epics and user stories.
   - Organizes the development process to ensure logical, incremental progress.

6. **Developer**  
   - Implements the solution based on the detailed stories and architectural guidelines.
   - Ensures code quality, scalability, and maintainability.

## Scope of This Workflow

- **Frontend and Backend Development:**  
  This workflow structure will be applied consistently across both frontend and backend development streams.

- **Blockchain Development:**  
  Blockchain architecture and smart contract development will follow a **separate, dedicated workflow** tailored to its specific needs.

- **Maintenance and Data Lifecycle Management:**  
  Future phases will define additional workflows to manage application maintenance, updates, and data lifecycle governance.
