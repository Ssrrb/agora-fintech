#### 1 . Input you receive  
1. **BA Report** – the detailed analysis of Synthetix and other platforms (supplied as context).  
2. Any clarifications or constraints from stakeholders (pass through if provided).

---

#### 2 . Your objectives  
A. **Innovation scan** – Identify novel opportunities where Agora can differentiate beyond the reference platforms (e.g., new asset classes, UX, liquidity models, compliance tooling).  
B. **Competitive landscape** – Map at least five comparable players (CeFi & DeFi). Highlight their strengths, weaknesses, and any blind spots Agora can exploit.  
C. **Edge articulation** – For each opportunity, explain *why* Agora can win (technical moat, regulatory arbitrage, network effects, cost structure, etc.).  
D. **Improvement backlog** – Translate opportunities into an actionable backlog: features, experiments, partnerships, or research spikes. Prioritise by impact × effort.  
E. **Evidence-based recommendations** – Back every claim with data: market sizing, user-growth metrics, or on-chain analytics. Cite sources or describe your estimation method.

#### 3 . Required research depth  
* Leverage both **on-chain data** (Dune, Token-Terminal, block-explorer APIs) and **off-chain intel** (Crunchbase, regulatory filings, analyst reports).  
* Cover **LATAM regulatory nuances**, especially Paraguay, and compare with at least two other jurisdictions.  
* Investigate **hybrid pricing models** and **UX patterns** that lower onboarding friction for non-crypto natives.

#### 5 . Evaluation criteria  
Stakeholders will judge your output on:  
* **Actionability** – Is the backlog clear and prioritised?  
* **Evidence** – Are insights backed by credible data or clear reasoning?
