RealAssetToken MVP: Research Report for Lean Backlog Development1. Executive SummaryThe RealAssetToken (RAT) Minimum Viable Product (MVP) aims to demonstrate a novel approach to accessing real-world assets through tokenization, focusing initially on equity. The core value proposition of the RAT MVP centers on providing users with 1:1 backed digital tokens representing fractional ownership in equities, facilitating 24/7 settlement capabilities, and operating within a framework of regulatory certainty. This report synthesizes research across various domains, including trading and custody infrastructure, blockchain technology, and regulatory landscapes, to inform the creation of a lean and testable backlog for the MVP. Key findings indicate the importance of carefully considering transaction fees associated with trading the underlying assets, the significant potential of Layer-2 blockchain solutions for achieving cost-effective token minting, and the comparative regulatory clarity offered by Seychelles for virtual asset service providers. The proposed approach emphasizes a streamlined "purchase-to-mint" user journey and the prioritization of essential features tied to measurable learning objectives. The subsequent steps involve the direct translation of these research insights into actionable backlog items to drive focused development sprints.2. Understanding the RealAssetToken MVP Landscape

2.1 Defining the Core MVP Value Proposition and ObjectivesThe RealAssetToken (RAT) MVP is predicated on three fundamental pillars: 1:1 asset backing, ensuring that each token represents a specific fraction of an underlying real-world asset; 24/7 settlement, aiming to provide users with the ability to transact with the token at any time, transcending traditional market hours; and regulatory certainty, establishing a clear and compliant operational framework for the token. These pillars are critical for the initial validation of the RAT concept as they address key pain points in traditional equity markets, such as limited accessibility, settlement delays, and regulatory complexities.
These core pillars directly align with the Core Objectives outlined for the MVP development process. Objective A, focusing on the Problem Slice, necessitates identifying the smallest viable equity-token flow (buy–mint–redeem for 1–3 NYSE tickers) to efficiently gauge market demand and minimize time-to-market. The 1:1 asset backing is fundamental to this flow, ensuring the token's value proposition. Objective B, Evidence Grid, mandates backing each proposed slice with concrete data regarding the Total Addressable Market (TAM), costs, regulatory pathways, and user feedback. This data-driven approach prevents scope creep and ensures that the MVP remains focused on validating the core value proposition. Objective C, Simple Journey, requires mapping the end-to-end user experience, from KYC to wallet receipt of the minted RAT. This process is crucial for aligning development teams and exposing any integration challenges early on, directly supporting the 24/7 settlement and regulatory certainty pillars by ensuring a smooth and compliant user experience. Objective D, Lean Backlog, involves breaking down the user journey into actionable backlog items (EPIC → USER STORY → TASK) tagged by Learning Goal, MoSCoW priority, and estimate. This structured approach drives sprint focus and facilitates smooth communication with the Architect, ensuring the MVP remains lean and delivers on the core objectives. Finally, Objective E, Validation Plan, emphasizes the definition of success metrics and data capture mechanisms for each sprint. This allows every release to serve as an experiment, providing valuable data on the effectiveness of the MVP in achieving its core objectives.


2.2 Review of Key InputsThe development of the RAT MVP will be informed by several key inputs, each providing unique perspectives and constraints. The Business-Analyst Discovery Pack serves as a foundational resource, offering insights into market pain points experienced by potential users, defining target user archetypes, providing preliminary regulatory notes relevant to the project, and offering initial cost and size estimates for various features. This pack is crucial for understanding the existing market landscape and identifying the most pressing user needs that the MVP should address. By leveraging this information, the MVP can be strategically designed to solve real user problems and demonstrate clear value.
Deep-Research Dossiers, which include analyses of competitors such as Synthetix, dYdX, Alpaca, and Fireblocks, provide valuable insights into existing solutions in the decentralized finance and brokerage spaces. These dossiers will be instrumental in understanding the fee schedules, settlement speeds, and custody models employed by both decentralized and centralized rivals. By examining the strengths and weaknesses of these competitors, Agora can identify opportunities to differentiate the RAT MVP and adopt best practices in its design and implementation.
Architect Constraints are paramount to the technical feasibility of the MVP. These constraints encompass limitations imposed by the chosen technology stack, acceptable latency and Service Level Agreement (SLA) limits, and guardrails related to smart contract development. Adherence to these constraints is non-negotiable, and any potential violations must be addressed through the protocol of raising a trade-off ticket that presents data-driven options for resolution. This ensures that the MVP is not only functional but also scalable and maintainable within the defined technical parameters.
Finally, Stakeholder Signals provide crucial direction from various parties invested in the success of the RAT MVP. These signals include the board's Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for the MVP, feedback received from regulatory bodies, Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) established with liquidity providers, and insights gathered from early-adopter interviews. Aligning the MVP's features and roadmap with these signals is essential for meeting the expectations of key stakeholders, validating market demand, and ensuring that the final product has a clear path to adoption and growth.

3. In-Depth Analysis of Core Components

3.1 Trading and Custody Infrastructure

3.1.1 Alpaca Trading Fees and Settlement

Alpaca's Commission-Free Model and Transaction Fees: Alpaca Securities LLC generally promotes a commission-free trading model for stocks, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), and options, primarily targeting algorithmic traders and fintech businesses.1 However, this commission-free structure may not apply universally, particularly if an account is established through an authorized business partner, in which case the partner's fee schedule would be applicable.1 Despite the lack of commission charges, Alpaca Securities LLC does impose transaction fees on certain securities transactions, including stocks, which are mandated by self-regulatory organizations, securities exchanges, and government agencies.8 For equities, these transaction fees include approximately $0.0000278 per dollar value of the transaction, a FINRA Trading Activity Fee (TAF) of $0.000166 per share (capped at $8.30 per transaction), and a regulatory transaction fee charged by the SEC, which is around $27.80 per $1,000,000 of principal for sell orders only.8 Additionally, a FINRA CAT Fee is applied to both equity and options trading, calculated based on transaction volume.8
Alpaca's Crypto Trading Fees: Alpaca Crypto LLC, a subsidiary handling cryptocurrency transactions, employs a maker/taker fee schedule that is tiered based on the user's 30-day trading volume in USD.12 These fees are calculated as a percentage of the executed order. For example, for a 30-day trading volume between $0 and $100,000, the maker fee is 0.15%, and the taker fee is 0.25%.12 The fee structure includes eight tiers, with fees decreasing as the trading volume increases, eventually reaching 0.00% for makers and 0.10% for takers at a volume of $100,000,000 or more.12 It is important to note that these fees are charged on the credited crypto asset or fiat currency per trade.12 Furthermore, Alpaca Crypto charges a separate fee for cryptocurrency wallet withdrawals, which is 50 basis points (0.5%) of the withdrawn amount.13
NYSE Equity Trade Settlement Speeds: The standard settlement cycle for most U.S. securities, including those traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), transitioned from two business days after the trade date (T+2) to one business day after the trade date (T+1) on May 28, 2024.14 This change was driven by technological advancements that have streamlined the processes involved in finalizing trades.14 Under the T+1 settlement cycle, if a security is bought or sold on a Monday, the transaction will typically settle by Tuesday.15 Certain types of securities, such as government bonds and options, already operated on a next-day settlement schedule even before this change.14 While the standard settlement is T+1, the concept of just-in-time (JIT) settlement aims for even faster finalization of trades.24 However, extending the settlement period beyond T+1 is generally not permitted as a standard practice.24


3.1.2 Fireblocks Custody Solutions and Costs

Fireblocks' Multi-Layered Security Approach: Fireblocks provides a robust platform for managing digital assets, emphasizing a multi-layered security approach that combines Multi-Party Computation (MPC-CMP) technology, secure hardware enclaves, and a sophisticated policy engine.28 This architecture is designed to eliminate single points of failure and protect against various threats, including cyberattacks and internal collusion.29 While Fireblocks offers custody solutions for a wide range of digital assets, it's crucial to note that for traditional equities traded through Alpaca, the legal ownership and clearing are handled by Apex Clearing. Fireblocks' role in this context is primarily focused on securing the private keys associated with the on-chain representation of these assets (the RAT token) and potentially co-signing minting transactions. Fireblocks may also record a tokenized 'position' for reporting purposes, but the ultimate source of truth for share settlement remains with Alpaca.
Fireblocks Pricing Structure: Fireblocks offers a tiered pricing structure with different plans like Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise, catering to various business needs and scales.34 The Essentials plan, suitable for getting started, includes options like "Pay As You Go" at $250 per month or $2,400 annually, which covers treasury management, wallet services, payments, and tokenization, along with a 0.23% transaction fee and custody for $100,000 in assets.34 For embedded wallets, the Essentials plan also offers a "Pay As You Go" option at the same price, including $0.90 per embedded wallet and $100,000 in asset custody.34 Higher volumes of embedded wallets come with tiered pricing, offering lower per-wallet costs.34 The Pro plan, designed for growing businesses, offers more features and higher limits, including higher outbound transfer volumes and more users.34 The Enterprise plan provides custom pricing and is tailored for large-scale operations with specific requirements.34 Fireblocks also offers direct custody Wallets-as-a-Service, allowing businesses to maintain control over their customers' private keys.30 According to Vendr's internal data, the average annual cost for Fireblocks software is around $123,000, though this can vary significantly based on the chosen plan and usage.35
Fireblocks Transaction Fee Estimation: Fireblocks provides API endpoints that allow clients to estimate transaction fees before execution.36 The "Estimate Transaction Fee" endpoint simulates a real transaction to calculate its potential cost, considering factors like source and destination amounts, and the number of inputs and outputs.38 Additionally, the "Estimate Network Fee" endpoint returns the current network fee for a specified blockchain, which is crucial for calculating the overall transaction cost, especially for EVM-based transactions where gas prices fluctuate.38 These tools allow for proactive management of transaction costs and can help ensure cost-effectiveness in operations.38





3.2 Blockchain Layer Considerations

3.2.1 Gas Costs for ERC-20 Minting on Ethereum Mainnet: Gas fees on the Ethereum mainnet are essential for compensating validators who secure the blockchain and process transactions.39 These fees are dynamic and are influenced by several factors, including the overall network congestion, the complexity of the transaction, and the price of Ether (ETH).39 The cost of a transaction is determined by the gas limit, which is the maximum amount of gas a user is willing to spend, multiplied by the gas price, which is the cost per unit of gas denominated in Gwei (a fraction of ETH).39 Simple ETH transfers typically require a gas limit of around 21,000 units, while ERC-20 token transfers usually consume more gas, often in the range of 45,000 to 65,000 units, depending on the token's smart contract implementation.42 Minting an ERC-20 token, which involves deploying or interacting with a smart contract to create new tokens, can be even more gas-intensive than a standard transfer.46 Gas prices can fluctuate significantly, with average prices varying over time.48 Strategies to mitigate high gas costs on the Ethereum mainnet include executing transactions during periods of lower network activity (off-peak hours), utilizing Layer-2 scaling solutions, and optimizing the smart contract code for gas efficiency.39
3.2.2 Gas Costs on Layer-2 Solutions (Optimism and Arbitrum): Layer-2 scaling solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum are designed to address the scalability challenges of the Ethereum mainnet by processing transactions off-chain and then posting a summary of these transactions back to the main chain, thereby significantly reducing gas costs and increasing transaction throughput.49 Estimated gas costs for ERC-20 token swaps on these Layer-2 networks are considerably lower compared to the Ethereum mainnet, often in the range of a few cents to a fraction of a dollar.52 For instance, Optimism and Arbitrum have shown significantly lower gas prices in Gwei compared to the mainnet.53 Optimism's fee mechanism involves an execution gas fee, similar to Ethereum, and an L1 data fee, which covers the cost of posting transaction data back to the mainnet.55 Arbitrum's fee structure includes costs for both parent chain resources (Ethereum) and child chain resources (Arbitrum's own network).56 On both Optimism and Arbitrum, the native token of Ethereum (ETH) is used to pay for gas fees within their respective networks.57



3.3 Regulatory Framework

3.3.1 Paraguay: Currently, Paraguay does not have specific regulations governing virtual currencies, and the Paraguayan Guarani is the sole legal tender in the country.58 The Banco Central del Paraguay (BCP) has issued public warnings regarding the risks associated with investing in digital assets.59 However, there have been legislative efforts to establish a regulatory framework. In July 2022, the Paraguayan Congress passed a bill that aims to regulate commercial activities related to virtual assets, including cryptocurrency mining and trading, but it does not propose making cryptocurrencies legal tender.60 This bill was then sent to the Executive branch for the President's potential signature or veto.63 Paraguay has also entered into an agreement with El Salvador, a country with a more established stance on cryptocurrency, to cooperate on digital asset regulation and anti-money laundering (AML) efforts.59 In September 2023, Paraguay created the Superintendency of Securities (Superintendencia de Valores) to replace the National Securities Commission (Comisión Nacional de Valores), with the goal of providing more robust and autonomous regulation of the securities market.72 Additionally, in April 2024, a draft bill was introduced proposing a temporary ban on cryptocurrency mining due to concerns about its impact on the national electricity supply.73
3.3.2 Seychelles: Seychelles has established a legal framework for virtual assets with the enactment of the Virtual Asset Service Providers Act 2024 (VASP Act), which came into force on September 1, 2024.67 This Act mandates a licensing regime for various Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) operating in or from Seychelles, including virtual asset wallet providers, virtual asset exchanges, virtual asset brokers, and virtual asset investment providers.67 The legislation requires VASPs to establish a substantial presence in Seychelles, which includes having a local office and appointing at least one resident director.68 Promoters of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are also required to register with the Financial Services Authority (FSA).67 Certain activities, such as the operation of mining facilities and mixer or tumbler services, are explicitly prohibited under the VASP Act.76 Existing entities providing virtual asset services were required to apply for a license by December 31, 2024 67, and there are specific fees associated with obtaining a VASP license.77


4. Designing the Lean MVP User Journey and Backlog

4.1 Mapping the Essential "Purchase-to-Mint" User FlowThe core user journey for the RAT MVP, focusing on the "purchase-to-mint" flow for a single equity ticker (e.g., AAPL), will involve the following steps:

KYC (Know Your Customer): The user will need to undergo a standard KYC process to verify their identity, adhering to regulatory requirements.
Fiat/USDC On-Ramp: Users will need a mechanism to deposit funds, either in fiat currency or USDC, to their account. This might involve integration with payment gateways or utilizing Alpaca's capabilities for fiat and crypto deposits.
Share Purchase: Once funds are available, the user will initiate a purchase of a fraction of the chosen equity (AAPL). This will be facilitated through integration with Alpaca's trading API.
RAT Mint: Upon successful purchase and confirmation of the share ownership (potentially involving settlement), the system will trigger the minting of the corresponding amount of RAT tokens. This will involve a smart contract on the chosen blockchain layer.
Wallet Receipt: The newly minted RAT tokens will be credited to the user's designated digital wallet.

Potential integration points include connecting the KYC process with Alpaca's account creation, integrating payment gateways for the on-ramp, utilizing Alpaca's API for order placement and settlement status, interacting with the RAT smart contract for minting, and ensuring compatibility with various user wallets for token receipt. Dependencies exist between each step, as the subsequent step relies on the successful completion of the preceding one. Potential blockers could include delays in KYC verification, latency in settlement confirmation from Alpaca, high gas costs on the blockchain preventing minting, or issues with wallet compatibility.


4.2 Identifying Critical Features for MVP Validation (MoSCoW Prioritization)To ensure a lean and focused MVP, the following features are prioritized using the MoSCoW method:

FeaturePriorityLearning GoalJustificationBasic KYC ProcessMust haveCan users successfully complete KYC within an acceptable timeframe and success rate?Essential for regulatory compliance and onboarding users.Single Ticker (AAPL) Purchase via AlpacaMust haveCan users seamlessly purchase a fraction of the designated equity through the platform?Core functionality for validating the "purchase" part of the flow.RAT Token Minting (1:1 Backed)Must haveCan the system accurately mint RAT tokens corresponding to the purchased equity?Fundamental to the core value proposition of 1:1 asset backing.Basic Wallet Integration (View Balance)Must haveCan users view their RAT token balance in a compatible digital wallet?Necessary to verify successful minting and token ownership.Manual Redeem Function (Admin Initiated)Should haveCan the platform facilitate the redemption of RAT tokens for the underlying asset (initially manual for MVP)?Crucial for completing the core "redeem" part of the flow, though automation can be deferred.USDC On-RampCould haveCan users on-ramp USDC to facilitate share purchase?Provides an alternative funding method but not strictly necessary for the initial buy-mint-redeem validation with fiat.Real-time Price DisplayCould haveCan users see the current price of the underlying asset within the platform?Enhances user experience but can be deferred if it adds significant complexity.24/7 Token TransferWon't haveCan users transfer RAT tokens to other wallets 24/7?While part of the long-term vision, the initial MVP focuses on the core buy-mint-redeem flow.

4.3 Formulating Measurable Learning Objectives for Each FeatureFor the "Must have" features identified above, the following measurable learning objectives are formulated:

Basic KYC Process: Can ≥ 80% of test users successfully complete the KYC process within ≤ 5 minutes?
Single Ticker (AAPL) Purchase via Alpaca: Can ≥ 95% of test users successfully place a buy order for a fraction of AAPL through the platform?
RAT Token Minting (1:1 Backed): Does the system accurately mint the correct amount of RAT tokens (based on the purchased fraction of AAPL) with a 100% accuracy rate? Is the average mint cost < USD 0.30?
Basic Wallet Integration (View Balance): Can ≥ 90% of test users successfully connect their wallet and view their RAT token balance?

Achieving these learning objectives will provide critical data points to validate the core value proposition and technical feasibility of the RAT MVP. Successful KYC completion indicates a smooth onboarding process. High success rates in share purchase demonstrate the platform's ability to interact with Alpaca's trading infrastructure. Accurate and cost-effective RAT token minting proves the fundamental mechanism of asset tokenization. Finally, the ability for users to view their token balance confirms the successful integration with digital wallets.

5. Technical and Integration Considerations

5.1 Leveraging the Fireblocks API for Transaction Signing and Webhook Notifications The Fireblocks API offers several functionalities that can be leveraged for the RAT MVP. For minting RAT tokens, the API's capabilities for creating new transactions can be utilized.100 This would likely involve a contract call operation to interact with the RAT token's smart contract deployed on the chosen blockchain layer.100 The API supports various types of transactions, including contract calls, which are essential for executing the minting function.100 To ensure the security of these transactions, the Fireblocks API can be used for signing them, providing a secure way to authorize the minting process.101 The process involves sending a payload containing the transaction details to the Fireblocks API, which then returns a signed transaction that can be broadcast to the blockchain network.101
Furthermore, Fireblocks provides webhook notifications that can be invaluable for tracking the status of transactions and other relevant events within the platform.102 For the RAT MVP, webhook notifications can be configured to monitor events such as transaction creation, status updates (e.g., pending, confirmed, failed), and potentially custody confirmations.104 To utilize this feature, a secure HTTPS endpoint URL needs to be configured within the Fireblocks Console or via the API, where the Agora backend can receive these notifications.102 It is crucial to handle these webhook events asynchronously and respond with a 2xx status code promptly to ensure reliable delivery of notifications.104 Securely validating the signature of the webhook event is also essential to confirm its authenticity.102


5.2 Implementing Observability and Logging using tools like GrafanaImplementing robust observability and logging is critical for monitoring the health, performance, and overall behavior of the RAT MVP.111 Grafana is a powerful tool that can be used to visualize key metrics related to the MVP's operation.115 For the RAT MVP, Grafana dashboards can be configured to display metrics such as the status of user orders, the latency in settlement confirmation from Alpaca, the status of RAT token minting transactions, and the balance of the gas wallet used for covering blockchain transaction fees.
The PoC document specifies the need for minimal but mandatory observability, including structured stdout in JSON-lines format. This structured logging will facilitate easier parsing and analysis of application logs within Grafana or other logging tools. Besides Grafana, other tools like Splunk and the Elastic Stack also offer comprehensive observability solutions for blockchain-based applications.126 Grafana also allows for the configuration of alerts based on defined thresholds for various metrics. For the RAT MVP, alerts can be set up to notify the development team via Slack or MS Teams if the gas wallet balance falls below a critical level (e.g., < 0.05 tETH) or if any step in the user journey exceeds an acceptable duration (e.g., > 2 minutes).


5.3 Addressing Architect Constraints and Potential Trade-offsAdhering to the architect's constraints is paramount for the successful delivery of the RAT MVP. These constraints encompass the limitations and guidelines related to the chosen technology stack, the acceptable levels of latency and the required SLAs, as well as any specific guardrails for smart contract development. Throughout the MVP development process, it is essential to maintain open communication with the Architect to ensure that all technical decisions align with these constraints.
During the research and planning phases, several potential trade-offs have emerged. One significant trade-off involves the choice of the blockchain layer for deploying the RAT token. While the PoC document mentions deploying on the Sepolia testnet, the production MVP could potentially leverage the Ethereum mainnet or a Layer-2 solution like Optimism or Arbitrum. The decision will need to balance factors such as transaction costs (gas fees), settlement speed, and the overall maturity and security of the network. Another potential trade-off concerns the extent of integration with Fireblocks. While Fireblocks offers robust security features for managing digital assets and signing transactions, the PoC indicates that it might be optional for the initial MVP. The decision to include Fireblocks in the first iteration will need to weigh its benefits against the added complexity and cost. When encountering any situation where an explicit architect or legal constraint might be violated, the established protocol is to raise a trade-off ticket. This ticket should clearly outline the potential violation, present data-driven options for alternative solutions, and provide a comprehensive analysis of the pros and cons of each option. This process ensures that all critical decisions are made in collaboration with the relevant stakeholders, considering both the business requirements and the technical and legal limitations.

6. UI/UX Principles for a User-Centric MVP

6.1 Best Practices for Financial Application DesignDesigning a user-centric financial application requires a strong emphasis on user research and testing to understand user needs and pain points.128 The interface should be user-friendly, clear, and simple, avoiding unnecessary complexity that could overwhelm users.129 Given that financial applications handle sensitive data and users' money, building trust through transparent security messaging, biometric authentication, and clear communication is paramount.129 Intuitive navigation and streamlined user flows are essential to ensure users can easily access key features and complete tasks without frustration.129 Presenting financial data in a clear and digestible format through effective data visualization, such as graphs and charts, can significantly enhance user understanding and engagement.129 Incorporating elements of gamification and rewards can also help to motivate users and make financial management more engaging.129 Personalization, tailoring the user experience to individual needs, and proactive engagement through timely and relevant notifications can further improve user satisfaction and retention.129 Clear error handling and mechanisms for recovery are crucial for maintaining user confidence when issues arise.128 Designing with accessibility and inclusivity in mind ensures that the application can be used by everyone, regardless of their abilities.131 Finally, maintaining a consistent design language across all aspects of the application creates a unified and familiar experience for the user.128


6.2 Ensuring Clarity, Security, and Ease of Use in the Purchase-to-Mint ProcessApplying these UI/UX principles to the RAT MVP's purchase-to-mint process is crucial for its success. The KYC process should be streamlined with clear instructions and progress indicators to ensure ease of completion and build user trust. The fiat/USDC on-ramp needs to be intuitive and secure, with transparent information about fees and processing times. The share purchase interface should be simple and straightforward, allowing users to easily select the desired ticker (initially just AAPL) and specify the purchase amount. The RAT minting step, while potentially happening in the background, should be clearly communicated to the user with a confirmation message and transaction details. Finally, the wallet integration should be seamless, allowing users to easily connect their existing wallets and view their RAT token balance. Throughout the entire process, clear visual cues should indicate security measures, and easily accessible help or FAQs should be available to address any user queries or issues.

7. Defining MVP Success and Validation
7.1 Establishing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Pre-MVP Exit
The success of the RAT MVP before exiting the initial phase will be evaluated based on the following criteria and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Success CriteriaKPITarget ValueCore Flow ProvenCompletion Rate of Buy-Mint-Redeem≥ 80 % of test usersCore Flow ProvenTime to Complete Buy-Mint-Redeem≤ 10 min for ≥ 80 % of test usersTech FeasibleAverage Mint Cost< USD 0.30Tech FeasibleSettlement Latency (Alpaca to RAT Mint)≤ T+2 (ideally near real-time with JIT)Reg-ReadyLegal Sign-offExplicit sign-off that MVP flow meets jurisdictional rulesEvidence-DrivenDecision TraceabilityEvery decision traceable to data or explicit experimentFocused ScopeParking-Lot Items< 15 itemsFocused ScopeUnplanned Scope AdditionsZero infiltrate sprintThese KPIs are informed by best practices in fintech MVP development, which emphasize the importance of user engagement, retention, conversion, and product performance.[141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154] For instance, a high completion rate of the core flow within a reasonable timeframe indicates that the fundamental user journey is functional and intuitive. Achieving a low average mint cost is crucial for the economic viability of the RAT token. Regulatory sign-off ensures compliance and mitigates legal risks. Adherence to a focused scope prevents feature creep and allows the team to concentrate on validating the core value proposition.


7.2 Developing a Validation Plan with Clear Success Metrics and Data Capture StrategiesThe validation plan for the RAT MVP will involve a series of sprints, each focused on building and testing specific parts of the "purchase-to-mint" user journey. Success metrics for each sprint will be directly aligned with the learning objectives defined for the features being developed. For example, the sprint focused on KYC implementation will track the completion rate and time taken for users to complete the process. The sprint involving share purchase will monitor the success rate of order placements via the Alpaca API. The minting sprint will measure the accuracy and cost of RAT token generation.
Data capture strategies will include the implementation of analytics dashboards to track key metrics such as funnel drop-off rates at each stage of the user journey, transaction fees incurred, and the latency of the minting process. User surveys and interviews will be conducted to gather qualitative feedback on the usability and overall experience of the MVP. A/B testing might be employed to compare different UI/UX designs or process flows to optimize for conversion and user satisfaction. The output of Objective E, a metrics dashboard specification, will guide the development of a centralized platform for visualizing and analyzing the data collected during each sprint, allowing the team to continuously monitor progress against the defined success metrics and make data-driven decisions for future iterations.
