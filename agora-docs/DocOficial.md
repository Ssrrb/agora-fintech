# RealAssetToken (RAT) – Whitepaper

## Version 0.1 – April 24 2025

---

### 1. Executive Summary
RealAssetToken (RAT) is a fully‑collateralised digital asset that represents ownership of publicly‑traded securities on a 1‑to‑1 basis. Each RAT is minted only after the underlying share is purchased through a regulated brokerage partner and placed in qualified custody. The protocol combines the transparency and composability of blockchain with the investor protections of traditional finance, enabling border‑less access to equities while remaining compliant with global regulatory standards.

### 2. Problem Statement
Traditional equity markets are fragmented, geo‑fenced and operate during limited hours. International investors face high fees, capital controls and settlement delays. Existing equity‑backed tokens either require over‑collateralisation or expose users to synthetic price risk. There is a clear need for a solution that provides:
- **True 1:1 backing** with on‑chain proof of reserves.
- **Instant, 24/7 settlement** and interoperability with DeFi.
- **Regulatory certainty** without sacrificing user ownership and control.

### 3. Solution Overview
RAT issues ERC‑20 tokens that are redeemable for the corresponding underlying share (e.g., 1 AAPL‑RAT = 1 Apple Inc. share). Tokens are minted *on demand*: when a user initiates a purchase, the protocol executes an immediate market order via an API‑enabled broker (e.g., Alpaca) and transfers the share to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) held by an institutional custodian (e.g., Fireblocks). Once the trade settles (T+0 or T+2 depending on venue), the smart contract mints tokens to the purchaser’s wallet.

### 4. Architecture
| Layer | Component | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **User** | Web/App | React + Ethers front‑end with embedded KYC flow |
| **Protocol** | Smart Contracts | Solidity contracts governing mint, burn, reserve audits and DAO voting |
| **Broker API** | Alpaca / Interactive Brokers | Executes buy/sell orders programmatically |
| **Custody** | Qualified Custodian + SPV | Holds the shares; issues daily Merkle proofs of holdings |
| **Oracles** | Chainlink × IEX | Provides real‑time price feeds and confirmations |
| **Compliance** | Sumsub / Persona | KYC/AML checks; Travel Rule messaging |

#### 4.1 Mint Process
1. User completes KYC and initiates a buy for *n* tokens.
2. Backend locks user funds (USDC, fiat) in escrow.
3. Broker API purchases *n* shares; custodian confirms receipt.
4. Contract mints *n* RAT tokens to the user.

#### 4.2 Burn / Redemption
1. User sends *n* RAT to the burn contract.
2. Backend instructs broker to sell or transfer *n* shares.
3. Proceeds (or shares) are delivered to the user; tokens are burned.

### 5. Token Economics
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mint fee  | 0.25 % of trade value |
| Burn fee  | 0.15 % |
| Annual custody fee | 0.50 % (accrues daily, collected on‑chain) |
| Governance token | **RAT‑DAO** (separate utility token) |

RAT‑DAO token‑holders vote on fee adjustments, asset whitelisting and treasury usage.

### 6. Legal & Compliance
- **Jurisdiction**: Primary SPV registered in Seychelles with VASP licence; fallback entities in Liechtenstein for EEA clients.
- **Regulatory classification**: Tokenised security; offerings restricted to *Qualified* or *KYC‑verified* investors depending on region.
- **KYC/AML**: Tiered approach—full KYC for primary issuance/redemption; on‑chain transfers permitted up to USD 1,000 per day between self‑hosted wallets before re‑verification.
- **Audit & Reporting**: Monthly external audit; daily proof‑of‑reserves pushed on‑chain via Chainlink CCIP.

### 7. Governance
A multi‑sig controlled by the RAT‑DAO Council manages contract upgrades. A full transition to on‑chain governance is planned at Mainnet + 18 months, pending regulatory approval.

### 8. Security
- Smart contracts audited by two independent firms.
- Custodian insurance up to USD 100 M.
- SOC 2 Type II certification for all backend infrastructure.

### 9. Roadmap
| Quarter | Milestone |
|---------|-----------|
| Q3 2025 | Testnet launch with sandbox brokerage integration |
| Q4 2025 | Mainnet + first asset (AAPL‑RAT) |
| Q1 2026 | Add ETFs (SPY‑RAT, QQQ‑RAT) |
| Q2 2026 | Launch DeFi collateral module (lend/borrow) |
| Q4 2026 | Cross‑chain expansion (L2s, Cosmos IBC) |

### 10. Risks & Mitigation
- **Counterparty Risk**: Minimized by segregated custody; insured.
- **Regulatory Risk**: Multiple jurisdictions, legal contingency fund.
- **Liquidity Risk**: Initial market‑making fund seeded by treasury; incentives for LPs.
